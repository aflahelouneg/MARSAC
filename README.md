MARSAC is an open-source framework coded in Python language that characterizes the anisotropic mechanical behavior of soft tissues. From an output video file gathered with the CutiScan® device during a ring suction test, MARSAC computes the displacement field using DIC and identifies the Langer’s line direction, as well as the elastic moduli along and across it, for a given Poisson’s ratio value.
